Thesis project - CRISPR CAD   
Paper coming soon   

### How to run?

1. Download the test models (https://drive.google.com/open?id=16vpNypJoY9_5_agDy-YWIICSG1ZjSybj) and index (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O19ZxEu7fPeQ5jHYGH12aZmU7ms3TdbK)
2. Unpack the test folder into models
3. Unpack ecoli.pkl to indices
4. Run python cad.py   

Alternatively, try building Docker image with docker build and run it with docker run.

### Notes
For a large genome full-scale off-target search takes a lot of time. Try search with only preselected guides.

### To do
1. Release Cpf1 model pack
2. Release Cas9 model pack based on DeepCRISPR
3. Release indices for frequently used organisms
